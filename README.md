A Federation plugin for Keycloak to be attached into a Realm, so that all clients can use it to authenticate / authorize (as long as roles are mapped) users according to external services or data stores.

This has the benefit to easily pull information from polyglot data stores and enrich users with attributes coming from different locations.

All clients in the same Keycloak Realm also have the advantage of an inherent SSO experience.
